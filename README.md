# Using-of-Machine-Learning-in-Space-physics-and-Astronomy
Machine learning is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.

Here I've applied ML to solve various astronomical problems, Please refer to indivisual directory for detailed ML applications in Astrophysics
