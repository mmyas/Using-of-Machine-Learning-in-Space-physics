Machine learning is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Recently, artificial neural networks have been able to surpass many previous approaches in performance.

Here I've applied ML to solve various astronomical problems, Please refer to indivisual directory for detailed ML applications in Astrophysics

1.Deep learning model for ship detection from satellite image

2.Deep learning model for solar panel detection

3.ML Exoplanet detection using transit photometry

4.ML algorithm to predict stars galaxies and quasars

5.ML model for sunspot detection

6.Solar power potential mapping

7.Deep learning model to identify fish species
